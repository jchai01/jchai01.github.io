<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>He does it all: directing, acting, scriptwriting, editing, choreography, stunts, and more. Even outside of filmmaking, he is a musician. He creates and sings his own songs too, which are usually heard in the closing credits of his films.</p><p>Remember, these accomplishments did not happen in the age of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/erZSLrLm2i8?si=bopDr7SDis8piiDW" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Take a glimpse</a> at how hard editing was back then. What other excuse do we have to not absolutely learn and do everything by ourselves in 2024? A level of resourcefulness we should all strive for.</p><h1 id=he-is-more-than-rush-hour-2>He is more than Rush Hour 2

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>When asked about your favorite Jackie Chan movie, there&rsquo;s a good chance you would name something from Jackie&rsquo;s Hollywood era, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong; the quality of his action sequences is something I can only dream of pulling off.</p><p>However, I would argue that his value lies in the golden age of Hong Kong action cinema. His movies produced during that era, along with <a href=https://www.easternfilmfans.co.uk/the-three-dragons-trilogy-an-overview-by-jamie-macdonald-and-paul-findlay/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>The Three Dragons</a>, define HK Action cinema. In terms of action, they are ahead of their time and unmatched even today.</p><h1 id=he-is-a-genre>He is a Genre
<a class=heading-link href=#he-is-a-genre><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Not only did he pioneer the genre of action comedy (unpopular opinion: his best fight scenes are ones where he doesn&rsquo;t try to be funny), but his filmography contains so many titles that he is essentially a genre; such a level of life dedication is inspiring.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
